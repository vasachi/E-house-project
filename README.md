Welcome to the Vehicle and Device Checkin System!

Project Overview
The Vehicle and Laptop Checking System is designed to simplify the process of checking in devices as per the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy within different organizations. This system allows individuals to register their devices with the system admin or security office, after which QR codes are generated and sent to the individuals. When individuals arrive, they simply display their QR codes, which are then scanned at the gate by a camera to signify that their devices and vehicles have been signed in. The system also generates separate QR codes for devices and vehicles, as well as a general QR code containing information for both devices and the vehicle, providing the flexibility for individuals to choose what they need to check in on any specific day.

This system was originally developed for the Kenya Power and Lighting company (KPLC) Central Rift Office Nakuru E-House, and received alot of contributions from the 
ICT attchees of January-March 2024.

Future Enhancements

One potential future enhancement of the system is to include parking allotment numbers when a person checks in with a vehicle. This addition would provide individuals with specific information about where to park their vehicles upon arrival at the premises. Additionally, when individuals leave the premises, they are expected to sign out by scanning the QR code as they leave.
